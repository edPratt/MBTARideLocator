# MBTARideLocator

#### This was done for a timed programming challenge which took about 1 hour. Problem to solve: using the MBTA V3 api and given a latitude and longitude, find the soonest mode of public transportation leaving from the closest stop to the given location while excluding all inbound trips, and return the trip id along with the time until arrival of the vehicle.

#### To use/run:
Use virtualenv if needed, or something similar

```
virtualenv -p python3 env
```

```
source env/bin/activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python main.py
```

Note: More information to use this module is documented in the class docstring

When done:

```deactivate```
            
```rm -rf env```
